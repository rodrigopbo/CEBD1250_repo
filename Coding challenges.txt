# 1.) Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message

num = input("Type a number: ")

# 2.) Expanding the previous exercise, letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

# 3.) Create a function that takes a list of numbers. Return the largest number in the list.

lv = [55, 3, 47, 90, 17, 333]

# 4.) Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

user_str = str(input("Type a word to know if it is a palindrome: "))
rev_user_str = reversed(user_str)

else:

# 5.) Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

def fib_num():
    num = int(input("Tell me how many Fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? "))
    x = 1
    if num == 0:
        fib = []

        fib = [1]
    elif num == 2:
        fib = [2]

            fib.append(fib[x] + fib[x-1])
            x += 1
    return fib
print(fib_num())
input()


# 6.) Write a program that takes a number and print its square.

square = input("Type a number to find out its square: ")
square = int(square)
result = square**2

print("The result is ", result)

# 7.) Given an list of positive integers with higher than 0 the answer should contain average values.

n=int(input("Type how many numbers you want to calculate the average: "))
a=[]

for i in range(0, n):
    elem=int(input("Type the number: "))
    a.append(elem)
avg = sum(a) / len(a)
print("The average of your numbers is: ", int(avg))

# 8.) Return the number of vowels per string.

data = input(("Please type a setence to dicover how may vowels it has: "))
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
for v in vowels:
    print(v, data.count(v))

# 9.) Write a program to convert degrees of Fahrenheit to Celsius.

fah = int(input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit to convert to Celcius: "))
cel = (fah -32) * 5/9

print(fah, " in Fahrenheit is ", round(cel), " in Celcius")
